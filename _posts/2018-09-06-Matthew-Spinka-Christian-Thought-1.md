> But let me hasten to say that I regard religion as an exception to the judgment applied to humanism in general—that most of its cultural elements have ended in relative failure. Without implying any exceptionally effective functioning of the Christian Church in society, and admitting its many faults and even failures, it is still true that it has exhibited a relatively more adequate understanding of essential humanism, in contrast to those who never attained it or subverted it. For it is an elementary Christian axiom that the autonomous man is selfish, being motivated solely by what he regards in a narrow sense as his personal advantage or pleasure. In Christian theology this is the sin of sins, the original sin. Unless and until the sinner—for this is what the man driven by egotistic motives and natural passions is—is transformed by the grace of God and surrenders his will to the Divine Will, he does not possess the true humanistic values. The failure to understand this, or the refusal to practice it, have been the primary causes of the failure of our humanist-secularist culture. Accordingly, Christianity as the true humanism, to the degree to which it has remained true to its ideal of transformed humanity—Sololev's Godmanhood—has escaped the worst consequences of the perverted notion of humanism.

> Furthermore, I agree with Arnold Toynbee's view that in the collapse of any given culture it is religion which normally survives as the "saving remnant of the subsequent emergent culture. In fact I cannot conceive of any culture worthy of the name which could be built on frankly irreligious or atheistic foundations. Even the "classless society" of which the Marxists talk so glibly—assuming for argument's sake that any such a fatuous concept is realizable, which is more than doubtful—could not possibly be established or perpetuated without good men and women—in other words, without religiously motivated and transformed members of society!

How can we daily be on our guard against this collapse of humanism into dehumanizing egotism? Each of us needs a center to our lives that is above our immediate or even conscious desires. Only then can our collapsed selves be made whole and strong again, by a power above us. 

What daily practices can we follow, if only to remind ourselves of our need to be made human once again?
