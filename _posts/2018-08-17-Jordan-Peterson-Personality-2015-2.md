How are we to pursue the work that we love and believe important when, as often happens, our employment consumes us and leaves only a brittle, empty shell of us at the end of each day? We are drained, all our rivers run dry. So then, we must draw on another reserve outside and above us, like an ocean in the sky: our vision of what our work could accomplish, how it could touch the lives of others and so change the world. With just the spark of our imagination, we can elaborate that vision in our mind and kindle a blaze to power our work to elaborate this vision in reality. Day-to-day survival may grind down our mind and body, but it cannot touch this hidden land, our soul, our potential that must reach out into reality and into other souls, bring their own hidden potential to bloom. How, then, can we daily exercise our imagination to draw on this energy and make our vision real?
