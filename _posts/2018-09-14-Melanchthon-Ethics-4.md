*Quaestio haec sit: An virtus sit finis hominis, an vero voluptas? / Let us investigate whether our purpose is virtue, or pleasure and entertainment.*

*Praecipua autem et speciosissima Epicuri argumenta haec sunt. / Here are the main (and most captivating) arguments of the Epicureans.*

*Primum. / First:*

<p class="latin">(a) Finis cuiuslibet naturae est hoc, ad quod ultro, magno impetu natura fertur, non illud, quod difficulter agit aliunde impulsa, ut lapidis motus deorsum naturalis est, sursum violentus. (b) Tendit autem humana natura ultro ad voluptatem. Econtra vero difficulter obtemperat legibus. (c) Ergo voluptas est finis.</p>

<p class="latin">Respondeo ad minorem. Nobis, qui scimus unde turbata sit harmonia virium in homine, facilis est solutio. In minore, fallacia est accidentis, quia per accidens fit, propter depravationem humanae naturae, ut tantum sit incendium malarum appetitionum, ut difficulter obtemperemus legi Dei. Sed si natura esset incorrupta, si Deus in nobis perfunderet nos luce sua, et flammis virtutum, universa obedientia iucunda esset. ... Sed in Philosophia vere et perspicue sic responderi potest: nego minorem, quia fallacia est a dicto secundum quid, ad dictum simpliciter. Non enim tota natura fertur ad voluptatem, sed mens ante factum et post factum repugnat. Nam post delicta, sequuntur tristissimi cruciatus. Impossibile est autem, finem naturae, eam rem aut actionem esse, quam natura tota post factum horribiliter aversatur, et potius non esse mallet, quam sustinere conspectum eius facti, ut David mallet non esse, quam sustinere cogitationem sui lapsus. Haec solutio manifestissime refutat Epicuraeos, ac ostendit, non ferri totam naturam ad voluptatem principaliter.</p>

> (a) The purpose of a thing is whatever it is naturally drawn toward, not what it has to be forced from the outside to follow. For example, a rock naturally moves downward, but upward only by force. (b) Human nature is naturally drawn toward pleasure, but obeys laws only when forced. (c) Therefore, pleasure is our purpose.

> We can easily reply to the minor premise, since we know what fragments the once-harmonious parts of our self: it is only because human nature was distorted, that we are filled with destructive tendencies and have a hard time obeying God's law. But if our nature were pristine and illuminated by the light of God and the flames of virtue, perfect obedience would be enjoyable. ... But from the standpoint of philosophy, we can just as easily deny the minor premise on the grounds that it is a false generalization. It's not true that our entire self is drawn to pleasure. Often this attraction leads to behavior that we try to resist beforehand, and that afterward we think of with remorse, or even with such disgust that we would rather not exist than to feel the weight of what we've done, as in the case of David and murderous adultery. How is it possible that such a volatile thing is our purpose? The Epicureans are wrong on this point, since clearly human nature is not drawn primarily to pleasure.

In an age flooded with romantic naturalism, it's easy to fall into the same trap of ratifying our "natural" (but really bent and unnatural) desires with an intellectual stamp of approval. What do we do day to day that we think unobjectionable just because it's natural and effortless, or because it's the normal thing to do in our society? What counterintuitive and difficult things should we do that we don't? How can we live not by what feels good momentarily, but by what *is* good?
