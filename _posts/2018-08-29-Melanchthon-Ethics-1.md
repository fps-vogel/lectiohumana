> Sed eadem de eisdem, vera et recta, et proprio sermonis genere dicere studeo. Nam profecto vera doctrinarum exordia proprie et eodem modo tradere adolescentiae valde prodest.

> But I am to say the same old things covering the same old ground: true and right, and spoken in a fitting way. It's very helpful to pass on to young people a firm foundation of teaching in an appropriate way and in the same way.

And yet how rarely now do we have a foundation to all we learn! It's important to have one, as we see, for example, in the enthusiasm over Jordan Peterson's mythic and psychological approach to all of life, and in Christopher Dawson's warning in *The Crisis of Western Education* that education and knowledge itself has devolved into a mass of disconnected specializations with little ethical or spiritual direction.

> Magna est enim Tyrannis pravae consuetudinis, et omnino verum est, quod inquit Aristoteles, αἱ ἀρκοάσεις κατὰ τὰ ἔθνη οὐμβαίνουσιν ὡς γὰρ εἰώθαμεν, οὕτως ἀξιοῦμεν λέγεσθαι.

> When we are used to seeing things the wrong way, a mighty tyrant holds power over us, and Aristotle was right when he said, "A talk is only as effective as what the listener is used to, because we expect to hear things said in the same way that we're used to hearing them, [and anything beyond this seems like strange nonsense because of its unfamiliarity]. (Metaphysics 2.3)

And so just reading the Great Books isn't enough, since we see everything through distorted lenses. We need not only to look in a new direction, but from a different perspective, hence Dawson's suggestion to study past cultures sociologically.
