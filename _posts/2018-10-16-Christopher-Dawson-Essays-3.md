> Thus St. Augustine, more perhaps than any other Christian thinker, emphasizes the social character of the Christian doctrine of salvation. For "whence," he writes, "should the City of God originally begin or progressively develop or ultimately attain its end unless the life of the saints were a social one?" But at the same time he makes the individual soul and not the state or the civilization the real centre of the historic process. Wherever the power of divine love moves the human will there the City of God is being built. Even the Church which is the visible sacramental organ of the City of God is not identical with it, since, as he writes, in God's foreknowledge there are many who seem to be outside who are within and many who seem to be within who are outside. So there are those outside the communion of the Church "whom the Father, who sees in secret, crowns in secret." For the two Cities interpenetrate one another in such a way and to such a degree that "the earthly kingdom exacts service from the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of heaven exacts service from the earthly city."

How amazing, that Augustine gives us a picture most individualistic (where history is worked out from individual souls) *and* most communal, where every soul is inevitably implicated in the many communities of two cities, and where each city is inevitably implicated in the otherâ€”and beneficially, since building up a virtuous temporal society does good in eternity as well. I wonder if this is how Augustine would interpret Paul's metaphor of the body parts: while some people serve the City of God directly in religious work, many others serve it by doing good in the earthly city.

How can we do good in our communities such that we make them more truthful and virtuous, thus bringing them closer to eternity?
