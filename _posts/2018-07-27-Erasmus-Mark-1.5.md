> Interim non oportet militem esse securum. Dedisti nomen Christo imperatori, renuntiasti Diabolo: accepisti auctoramentum ac donativum, velut arrhabonem tui salarii, Spiritum Sanctum, ad palmam oportet contendere. Ea non contingit oscitanti, arma capessas oportet, ne te hostis, qui nusquam non insidiatur, incautum atque inermem opprimat. Oppugnabit illico mundus, oppugnabit Satanas, oppugnabit te caro tua: semper pugnandum est, ut semper vincas. Neque enim prius erit finis pugnae, quam vitae: sed tamen quo saepius hostem tuum viceris, hoc et ille discedet a conflictu debilior, et tu robustior. (1.13)

> In the meantime [while Christ has made you a son of God] a soldier should not be carefree. You've given your allegiance to Christ your captain, and renounced Satan. You've received a pledge of your reward, the Holy Spirit, so fight for victory! And victory won't fall into your lap while you're napping. Take up arms so that the enemy, who ambushes us at every turn, doesn't catch you careless and unarmed. Here the world will oppose you, there Satan, and there again your evil tendencies. You must continually fight, if you are to continue in victory, and the fight will not end before the end of your life. But the more often you win against the enemy, the weaker he will limp away in retreat, and the stronger you will become.

No rest? No arrival? No problem. The good life is a lifelong struggle. Outward success and contentment has nothing to do with our victory in the battle, and these are often a hindrance to victory because they distract us from the important questions of life. Misery can bring hatred if we are not careful, but it also brings us closer to the heart of our human condition and our redemptive work in the world.

> Quid autem Iesus praedicans in Galilaea regnum Dei? ... Galilaea Syris transmigrationem sonat. ... Itaque iuxta sensum mysticum, quicumque volunt audire Christum praedicantem, a pristinis ritibus et cupiditatibus demigrent oportet, ut novae coelistique doctrinae possint esse capaces. (1.14)

> Why did Jesus declare the kingdom of God in Galilee? To the Syrians Galilee meant migration, so the hidden meaning is that whoever wants to hear Christ's proclamation must go on a journey away from their original habits and appetites, so that they are ready for a new and heavenly teaching.

Even if our present way of life seems great, a total change in place and routine can reveal much about ourselves, whether that journey is time spent abroad, or a move and a new job, or a tragedy that changes the meaning of our old surroundings. Even when we don't happen to undergo such a drastic transition, how can we periodically view our life from the outside and keep from becoming comfortably unthinking about our behavior? How can we remind ourselves that we are in exile and must constantly aim higher to reach our home?
