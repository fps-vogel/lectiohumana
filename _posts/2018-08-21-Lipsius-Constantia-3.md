> Rationi origo a caelo, immo a deo est, et magnifice eam Seneca celebravit: *Partem in homine divini spiritus mersam.* Est enim haec eximia illa intellegendi iudicandique vis: quae, ut anima perfectio hominis, sic ipsa animae est. ... Emicant enim semper subsiliuntque illi igniculi, qui in his tenebris illustrant, in his sordibus depurgant, in his ambagibus dirigunt, et ad Constantiam ducunt et Virtutem. Atque ut heliotropium et flores quidam ingenio suo semper ad solem, sic Ratio ad deum obversa est, et originem sui. Firma in bono et immota: unum idemque sentiens: unum idemque appetens aut fugiens: recti consilii, recti iudicii fons et scaturigo. Cui parere, imperare est: et subici, praeesse rebus omnibus humanis. Domuit enim cupidines et exsultantes animi motus, quisquis hanc audit: et in omnibus vitae labrynthis tutus ab errore, qui hanc sequitur ut Theseium filum. Deus ipse per hanc sui imaginem ad nos venit, immo quod propius est, in nos: et recte ille quicumque dixit, *Bona mens sine deo nulla est.* (5)

> Reason comes from heaven, from God, and Seneca magnificently commends it as "the part in a person imbued with the divine." Reason, the extraordinary power to understand and to judge: as the soul is the highest perfection of a person, so reason is to the soul. ... Its little flames glimmer and jump, giving light in the darkness. It cleans up the mess, it guides us in a maze of paths, and it leads us to steadiness and virtue. Like the heliotrope and other flowers that turn toward the sun, so reason is oriented to God its source, and fixed in the good. Reason feels one thing, desires one thing, and avoids one thing. It is a spring of right plans and right judgment. To obey it is to command powerfully, and to subject yourself to it is to hold authority over all human things. Whoever listens to reason tames his urges and moods, and he cannot make a wrong turn in life's labrynthine ways, who follows reason as the thread of Theseus. As Logos God himself came to us as Reason which is the image of God, or rather he came into us. As Seneca again rightly said, "There is no good mind without God."

How are we to judge rightly? How are we to see a thing as it truly is, to follow the good and avoid all that is empty or false? So much distorts our vision, especially the values held by people in our particular society, and our desire to gain a place in that society. This is no less true in a "Christian nation," no less true in this age of science.

If we doubt the path which we follow, if we wonder where the good is that in simpler days we set out to reach, let us stand back from ourselves and consider our course and our direction as if we were scrutinizing another person. Only then, perhaps, can we judge by reason and not by the fears and desires which are too volatile to serve as reliable guides.
