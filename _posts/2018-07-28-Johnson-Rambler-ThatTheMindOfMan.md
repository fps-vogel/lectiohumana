> The natural flights of the human mind are not from pleasure to pleasure, but from hope to hope.

Yet often we forget to hope, surrounded as we are by mindless pleasures whose analgesic power against despair far surpasses the consolation of hope, which requires also the hard effort of progress if it is not to be ridiculous. A young man is stuck in menial labor with no better prospects in sight: he cannot hope for a better situation, unless he spends his off-hours in study and the practice of some new skill which might open up a career. But hateful employment grinds down his willpower and saps the energy of his mind, so that he finds no pleasure in work for the future but hungers only for instant relief in cheap distraction. And so he plays or watches his hours away, until the dreaded hour of work comes again. Hope is the best pleasure, but also the hardest-won.

> He that directs his steps to a certain point, must frequently turn his eyes to that place which he strives to reach; he that undergoes the fatigue of labour must solace his weariness with the contemplation of its reward.

The exercise of the imagination would help that young man. Not in imagining how many more pleasures he would enjoy in a higher place in life, since the pleasures within our reach are better than the shadowy riches of the future; but in imagining how much better a person he could be if he invested in himself, how much he could give to others, even to help them rise out of the despair that he conquered with imagination and effort.
