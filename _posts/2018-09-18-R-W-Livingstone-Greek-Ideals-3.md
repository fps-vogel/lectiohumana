> But those who knew Greece naturally turned from Cobbett and the Manchester school to Pericles and Plato, from Leeds and Wigan to Athens, from self-satisfied mercantilism to a civilization without machines or vast towns or great material resources, but with a soul. ... What disquiets [Matthew] Arnold and draws him to Greece is not merely the weakness of which he complains in literature, but the whole life of his age. He turns with disgust from contemporary ideals in politics, religion and social life, from the 'Thyestean banquet of claptrap which English public life for these many years past has been', from 'the conception of free-trade, in which our Liberal friends think they have found the secret of national prosperity', from the belief that 'our coal is the real basis of our national greatness', from 'a life of jealousy of the Establishment, disputes, tea-meetings, openings of chapels, sermons', to 'the spectacle of the culture of a *people* . . . , the middle and lower classes in the highest development of their humanity that these classes hav yet reached', which, Arnold thinks, makes 'a handful of Athenians of two thousand years ago more interesting than the millions of most nations our contemporaries'. Seeing a world which it misused, he attempted to propound to it 'the old Socratic commonplace *Know thyself* . . . , to bring things under the light of one's intelligence, to introduce into the 'narrow and inadequate Puritan's ideal of perfection' some Hellenic 'sweetness and light'.

How can we look to the Greeks to supply what we've left behind in our material progress, to enrich us where we've become poor?

But then, we have to be careful and historical in our investigation:

> Even Arnold, who understood Greece far better, was not happy in defining its genius. The famous phrase 'Sweetness and Light' is a nebulous, inaccurate and inadequate description. One could wish in another world to hear Socrates cross-examining 
Arnold on the meaning of 'sweetness' and on its applicability to the Greeks.
