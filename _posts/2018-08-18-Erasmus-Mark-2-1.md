> Quin potius ex his, quae cernitis oculis, quaeque non potestis infitiari, ea colligitis esse vera, quae non possunt oculis cerni? Offendit vos haec vox, *Remittuntur tibi peccata:* et putatis irritam, quia non videtis efficaciam, quae sese exserit in animo. Vos autem cum habeatis oculos corporis sanos, mentis oculos habetis vitiatos. Quid si depromam huic similem vocem, cuius efficacia se probet oculis vestris, an non aequum est, ut ex eo quod cernitis, credatis etiam id quod non cernitis? Nihil est apud homines facilius, quam dicere: difficillimum autem praestare quod dixeris. Apud deum autem eadem est facilitas et dicendi et perficiendi. Hanc potestatem si hactenus Dominus non dedit homini, non est tamen illi adempta facultas dandi, cui velit. ... Audistis unam vocem et calumniamini, audite nunc alteram, quam calumniari non poteritis, ubi videritis palam rem dicto esse comitem. (10)

> Why don't you infer from these undeniable realities that you see with your eyes, that those things also are true that you cannot see with your eyes? You are offended by what I said, "Your sins are forgiven," and you think it useless because you don't see it working in the soul. But though your bodily eyes are just fine, the eye in your mind is clouded. What if I said something similar to this, whose result you could see with your eyes? Shouldn't you then believe even what you don't see? Speaking is easy, but doing what you speak is very difficult. For God it's just as easy to speak as to act accordingly; if this power has not yet been given to a person, it can yet be given to one who wishes for it. ... You heard me say one thing and you criticized it. Now listen to something else which you won't so easily dismiss: here you'll see with your eyes reality matching the thing said.

How difficult would it be always to try to act according to our speech? To behave so that the reality around us matches what we say? We do not do this by social custom. Instead, keeping silent about the reality we see, we are non-confrontational or quietly conform to a persona far from ourselves. Or using words that describe a different reality, we lie and tell what is convenient rather than what is true. But in speaking the truth there is power: maybe not in our case the power to heal a paralytic, and maybe an unpleasant power (for Jesus it led to execution), because it isn't a power that brings advantage to the person wielding it, but a power that brings goodness into the world. How can we retrain ourselves to speak truth always? Even in trivial situations, where it would seem silly or awkward or socially inappropriate to speak the absolute truth. Wouldn't it be useful even then to be truthful, to stamp out that deceitful reflex which recurs in more serious situations? We would have to make one exception: where it would clearly do harm to the listener for no justifiable good. But with the good of others as our rule, we would on the whole speak more truthfully.
