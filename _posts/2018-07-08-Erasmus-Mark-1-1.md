> Cunctis mortalibus insitum est, ut felicitatem expetant. Hanc multi mundana quadam sapientia praepollentes, alii proditis legibus, alii traditis praeceptis recte vivendi, hactenus polliciti sunt. Sed quoniam homines erant, non valuerunt praestare, quod pollicebantur. Nec enim noverant, quaenam esset vera hominis felicitas, aut quibus in rebus sita. Proinde factum est, ut pro vera felicitate fallacem quandam felicitatis imaginem sint amplexi, et errorem suum in alios transfuderint, falsi simul et fallentes. (1.1)

> Everyone chases after happiness, and all kinds of people promise it: the life-hackers, the politicians, the bureaucrats, the altriusts. But, mere mortals as they are, they haven't delivered. They don't even know what on earth real happiness is or where to find it, and so instead of happiness they've latched onto some inferior copy of it and inflicted their error on other people, deceiving while themselves deceived.

We migh add to that list the tech enthusiasts. How many of us have not seen someone praising and showing off a new mobile device after church? I myself take up new tools if they're helpful, but how often I let them become ends in themselves, as if to stare at a shiny hammer while sitting on a leaky roof, the storm quickly approaching.
