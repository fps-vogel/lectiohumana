> Nor is it only in international relations that [a clear view of life] is needed. Without it the individual cannot bring harmony and order into the tumultuous mixture of instincts, desires and opportunities which compose life. He, too, becomes confused and chaotic. 'Barbarism is the absence of standards to which appeal can be made' (José Ortega y Gasset). If so, to judge by our films, advertisements, and cheap press, we are living in an age of barbarism.

> If our greatest needs are clear standards and a definite philosophy of life, the classics can help us. This, though it is one of the strongest arguments for their study, is not the one to which we are most accustomed. The Greeks did of course produce a great art and architecture, and a literature greater still. They were the creators of science, philosophy, political thought, and much else. But they did something even more important. They were the first people to ask rationally what is the right life for man and to give, if not the most satisfactory answer ever given to this question, at any rate one which no intelligent man who realizes the problem can ignore. The attempt to make life rational and worthy, to introduce harmony into its discords, order into its chaos, system into its profuse abundance—how rarely has it been made, how seldom succeeded!

When we read, when we think, when we pray, when we remember our past life or imagine the future, when we work, when we watch movies or sing, let us always have this question on our minds, so that it guides our whole life, so that we don't split into Me Thinking and Me Having Fun. Even our leisure should be good, lifting up our spirit, and our work musn't be so dry and deadening as to drive us to cheap pleasures.
