How can we bring anger under our control? Not the annoyance that we feel toward a particular person due to their accident, incompetence, or malice; but the rage that boils over when we are reminded that we are drifting far from where we aimed to be, out of place and seemingly powerless against the rushing current. Our hopes and dreams have been smashed, our ideals proven flimsy, our very self bent and battered so that we don't know who we are, so that what energy remains in us bursts forth as vicious anger, bent on destroying life because it has destroyed us. What to do? How can we put a bit in the mouth of this beast and control it, seeing that we cannot kill it? (Nor should we, since it is part of us.)

If the answer to minor annoyances is forgiveness toward the offender, could we forgive amid our rage as well? Forgive life, and forgive God its author, and forgive ourselves for not fitting with our ideals. More than that, see what unexpected good has come of our seeming ruin, what we have learned and how much higher we can now aim than if our ideals had not been pushed to their breaking point. See that life is greater than our aims, and God more mysterious. See how much more we have to learn, and set out once again based on what we have learned. Let us not throw out our oars in defeat, nor struggle against the current back to where we were before, but steer toward that place where we can do the most good, where we can truly work and live, even if that seems less likely than going back.
