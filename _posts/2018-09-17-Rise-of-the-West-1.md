> The mature Greek polis exercised an extraordinarily pervasive influence upon the lives of its citizens. Politics tended to coincide with life itself, and little indeed was left private. Democratic Athens found it quite natural to demand that the citizens' time, wealth, and wholehearted devotion be lavished upon public affairs, while Sparta outdid any modern totalitarian regime in the demands and regulations it imposed upon its citizens. Yet this invasion of privacy seems to have been accepted willingly enough, perhaps because, to a degree unparalleled in modern times, the citizens did in fact constitute the state. Each individual citizen could rightly feel that the polis was not an alien, outside entity, but an integral extension and collective magnification of his personal life and powers. Under these circumstances, experience could be widely shared wihtout losing its intimate intensity, thereby unveiling new dimension of human character and unleashing fresh springs of collective energy to produce the extraordinary flowering of classical Greek culture.

Granted that today we cannot find a society that harmonizes with each individual so beautifully, we can at least weigh our options in the choice of life, so that we reach as near as possible to this flourishing. Is there a place where we can pour our soul into our work and into our fellow workers, thus making long work hours no burden but a joyful participation in a greater movement? On the other hand, is there a place where we can escape from slavery to work, living a simple life and enjoying precious time with our family in exchange for material poverty? We musn't sink into a patch of the regular social fabric, with its meaningless days of work and empty social routines, when we can go out and find these islands of flourishing life, though we may have to weigh each one's disadvantages.
