> Fluxus, inquam, omnis et refluxus hic rerum humanarum, ab illa Luna dependet: ortus regnorum et occasus, ab illo Sole. Itaque tu nunc cum fraena dolori tuo laxas, et indignaris patriam tuam converti aut everti: ne illud quidem cogitas, quis et in quem, indignere? Quis? Homo, umbra, pulvis? In quem? Formido dicere, in deum. Vetustas gigantes quosdam fabulata est, qui divos deturbare aggressi de sua arce. Mittamus fabulas: vos queruli, ii estis. (14)
{:.latin}

> The ebb and flow of human endeavors follows the moon, while rulers rise and fall with the sun. So now when you give free reign to your bitterness and resent the overthrow or change of your country, don't you ask yourself at whom you're angry?At a person, a shadow, a cloud of dust? You're afraid to say God. The ancients passed down a legend about giants who tried to topple the Gods from their thrones. It's more than a legend, though. You, who complain against God, are those giants.

How can we avoid becoming angry at God? By not having expectations? By not making plans? By making our sphere of activity totally internal (e.g. this blog)? Then we would live a double life, and we'd have to be dead to our outer life, not caring that it's inconsistent with our inner vision. How then can we bring our two lives into line?
