> Perhaps the greatest service of Plato to morals is that he forced his hearers to face the question, What really satisfies man? and all subsequent Greek ethical thought might be resolved into a series of answers to it. First Plato, then Aristotle, then Diogenes and the Cynics, then Epicurus, then the Stoics, attempted to define the life which it was natural for man to lead. The age of criticism passed into an age of construction whose creations only fell with the fall of the Roman Empire, and whose underlying philosophoy may be called humanismâ€”the doctrine that man's task is to ignore the vanities and passing desires which distract and seduce him, and to seek with an undivided aim what satisfies the fundamental needs of human nature. That philosophy of humanism, first propounded by Plato, is interpreted in varying ways by his successors. But in the essential points all agree. None of them are deceived by the ideals of wealth or power, or fame. All of them are ruled by a directing purpose which saves them from the moral nihilism of the 'democratic man'. All of them accept Plato's distinction between a higher and a lower in human nature. All of them find their goal in a spiritual state. A philosophy with these traits is the sort of philosophy we need.

How can we not only know what satisfies us, but also practice it daily? Rather than spending all our time on our to-do list, why not put some things off, not so that we can aimlessly waste time as people generally do, but so that we can purposefully pursue what we know satisfies us and nourishes our soul?
