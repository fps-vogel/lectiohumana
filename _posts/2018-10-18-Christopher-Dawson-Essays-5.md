> The real meaning of history is something entirely different from that which the human actors in the historical drama themselves believe or intend. For example, to a contemporary "scientific" historian the rise of the world empires in the Near East from the 8th to the 6th centuries B.C. would have seemed the only historical reality. He could not have even imagined that 2,000 years later all this drama of world history would only be remembered in so far as it affected the spiritual fortunes of one of the smallest and least materially civilized of the subject peoples. And in the same way what contemporary observer could have imagined that the execution of an obscure Jewish religious leader in the first century of the Roman Empire would affect the lives and thoughts of millions who never heard the names of the great statesmen and generals of the age? (72-3)

> The Augustan age could not have foretold the triumph of Christianity, nor the Byzantine age the coming of Islam. Even in our own generation, the best political observer of twenty years ago never guessed the possibility of the destruction of Parliamentarism in Central Europe by the advent of Fascism. But while all this is a scandal and reproach to historical rationalism, it offers no difficulties to the Catholic who lives in the presence of mysteries and who knows that "the way of man is not in himself." To the ordinary educated man looking out on the world in A.D. 33 the execution of Sejanus must have appeared much more important than the crucifixion of Jesus, and the attempts of the Government to solve the economic crisis by a policy of free credit to producers must have seemed far more promising than the doings of the obscure group of Jewish fanatics in an upper chamber at Jerusalem. Nevertheless there is no doubt today which was the most important and which availed most to alter the lot of humanity. All that Roman world with its power and wealth and culture and corruption sank into blood and ruin—the flood came and destroyed them all—but the other world, the world of apostles and martyrs, the inheritance of the poor, survived the downfall of ancient civilization and became the spiritual foundation of a new order.

> ... the progress of the new world is an invisible one and its results can only befully seen at the end of time. Apparent success often means spirit-ual failure, and the way of failure and suffering is the royal road of Christian progress. (75-6)

This mysterious working out of events happens on a smaller scale in each of our lives as well. The most reasonable path is not always the best; success and fulfillment are often found in surprising places, and disappointment where it was not expected. How can we embrace this indeterminacy of the course of our lives? In the flux of time, amid unexpected turns, how can we yet tread a path forward and upward, not losing sight of the blazing vision that sent us forth, not losing sight of that good which we set out to find?
