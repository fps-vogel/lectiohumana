> There are, as it were, two levels of rationality, and history belongs to neither of them. There is the sphere of completely rationalized human action—the kind of rationality that we get in a balance sheet or in the plans and specifications of an architect or an engineer. And there is the higher sphere of rationality to which the human mind at- tains, but which is not created by it—the high realities of philoso- phy and abstract truth. But between these two realms there is a great intermediate re- gion in which we live, the middle earth of life and history; and that world is submitted to forces which are both higher and lower than reason. There are forces of nature in the strict sense and there are higher forces of spiritual good and evil which we cannot mea- sure. Human life is essentially a warfare against unknown powers—not merely against flesh and blood, which are themselves ir- rational enough, but against principalities and powers, against "the Cosmocrats of the Dark Aeon," to use St. Paul's strange and disturbing expression; powers which are more than rational and which make use of lower things, things below reason, in order to conquer and rule the world of man.

We as individuals are all the time being swayed by irrational forces, and now and then we lose control of our own mind. Depression, anger, fear—by these we are hijacked and rendered senseless and thoughtless.

How can we be on our guard against these subrational forces? What can we do every day, what can we think and practice in advance, to better prepare us for an unexpected turn of events that threatens to plunge us into chaos?
