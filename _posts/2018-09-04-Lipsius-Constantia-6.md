> Cum omnes igitur affectus, Lipsi, qui vitam humanam varie incurrunt et turbant, a dementi mente sint: tum, meo animo, dolor praesertim, qui de republica sumptus. Nam cum ceteri finem aliquem habeant et tamquam scopum (ut amator potiri; iratus, ulcisci; avarus, acquirere; itemque in ceteris:) soli huic nihil propositum reperies, praeter ipsum. Ne vaga et illibera nimis oratio mea sit, sed adductis habenis maneam in hoc gyro: nempe tu patriam nunc luges, ut ais, corruentem. Sed qua fini, cedo? aut quid speras in eo aut spectas? Utrumne ut rem lapsam corrigas? labentem firmes? an ut dolendo imminentem patriae pestem perniciemque depellas? nihil horum. Tantum ut tritum illud possis dicere, *Doleo.* (13)

> All moods that destabilize you, Lipsius, are signs of a mindless person, especially depression over the sorry state of your country. Other moods at least have a goal: a person who's turned wants to have sex; angry, vindication; greedy, money or stuff; and so on. Only in this depression you won't find any point, other than itself. In short, you are lamenting your ruined homeland: but to what end? What do you hope to achieve by your misery? To fix what's ruined? To defend your country from further damage? No, only so you can say, "I'm depressed." Typical.

As we're told to count to ten before becoming angry, let's count to ten thousand before letting sadness take over, especially sadness over the way the world is, how low civilization has sunk, or at what point in history I was born.
