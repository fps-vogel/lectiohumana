> Grandinis hibernos Boreas exsolverat imbres,  
> Brumaque Iudaei iam parte recesserat anni,  
> Et caput abdiderat lapsum tellure sub alta,  
> Cum petit obliquo coeli fastigia cursu  
> Sol pater, et lentis crudam coquit ignibus auram.  
> Parturit omnis ager; silvaeque herbaeque recentes;  
> Et viridem pictis intexunt floribus oram;  
> Vocibus et blandis coeli iucunda salutat  
> Lumina progenies pecudum; pubesque volantum  
> Per nemus omne canit, nidis emissa relictis.  
> In se mersa fluit glacies; et laeta propago  
> Ludit ubique vadis; nullisque offensa procellis  
> Aequora marmorei rident immania ponti.  
{:.latin}

> Boreas' ice-chilled breath has blown cold rains far away.  
> Winter, its time now passed, moves on from the country of Judah,  
> Hiding its wrinkled, grey head beneath the dank deeps of the earth.  
> Father of all, the Sun, climbing up to the towers of heaven,  
> Warms the spring air with his fiery blaze as he flies to his throne.  
> Field and stirred wood now bloom, giving birth to a sea of green,  
> Clothing and painting their child with endless color of flowers.  
> Calves, in their joy of new life, greet the high heavens with lowing,  
> As do the birds' little children, flapping their wings through the air.  
> Streams lined with ice melt away; their shallows bubble with fish  
> Enjoying the days when the Sea, not raging in lonely storms,  
> Laughs with a quiet peace, at one with its brother Sky.  

Samuel Gott's 1948 novel *Nova Solyma* is peppered thick with poetry, and I have a hunch that they play a part as important as the prose. So I'll be posting the poems, sometimes (as here) with my own translation, or I may draw from Begley's English translation linked below.

In this translation I've tried to preserve the hexameter in English, like so:  
*BO*reas' *ICE*-chilled *BREATH* has *BLOWN* cold *RAINS* far a*WAY*.  
*WIN*ter, its *TIME* now *PASSED*, moves *ON* from the *COUN*try of *JU*dah.
