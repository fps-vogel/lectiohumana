> With regard to the pupil, there is a famous dilemma which has haunted reflection on education for long enough. Is learning to be understood as acquiring knowledge, or is it to be regarded as the development of the personality of the learner? Is teaching concerned with initiating a pupil into an inheritance of human ahievement, or is it enabling the pupil to make the most or the best of himself? Like many such cruxes, this one points to what I believe to be a genuine discrepancy, but misinterprets it. ... What, I think, we must understand is that there is no discrepancy between a pupil succeeding to his inheritance of human achievement and his making the most of himself. "Self-realization" for human beings is not, of course, the realization of an exactly predetermined end which requires only circumstances favorable to this end in order that it should be achieved; but nor is this self an infinite, unknown potentiality which an inheritance of human achievement is as likely to thwart as to promote. Selves are not rational abstractions, they are historic personalitites, they are among the components of this world of human achievements; and there is no other way for a human being to make the most of himself than by learning to recognize himself in the mirror of this inheritance.

How can we learn and teach not merely by possessing knowledge of our past, but by doing this and also holding it up as a mirror, seeing ourselves (or our opposites) in our predecessors, seeing what is to be aimed at (or avoided) in societies past? To some extent this is natural, but how can we encourage it, and not in a way too morally simplistic?
