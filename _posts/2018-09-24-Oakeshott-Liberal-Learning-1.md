> Oakeshott believed that we might consider becoming less preoccupied with the world of getting and spending, less prone to measure our well-being in quantitative terms, allowing ourselves to find delight in the poetic interstices of the daily world. This means looking for the possibilities available to us in the present, not always thinking that we must commit ourselves to what may come in the future. Abstracting ourselves from present circumstances, a liberation that is at best partial, for the sake of an idyllic future, moves us toward constant dissatisfaction and anxiety, thinking that all present accomplishments are of little value compared with a hypothetical perfection that we have taught ourselves forever to seek. (xi)

> Yet, for Michael Oakeshott, the idea of an activity is necessarily, inevitably, interwoven with, and emergent from within, the continuous practice of the activity. If we do not now find it easy to pick out the salient features of teaching and learning, it is in part because we do not now enjoy a clarifying experience of them. ... Oakeshott's reflections on teaching and learning uniquely attend to just these neglected features. He offers no checklist of things that every educated person ought to know. The checklist approach must narrow the sense of adventure into uncharted intellectual seas, obscuring the point that one is educated not merely because of what one knows, but as much or more for the manner in which one learns. (xix)

(Foreword and Introduction by Timothy Fuller.)

Even if we steer clear of piling up money or possessions, even if we value above all the life of the spirit and of the mind, are we yet consumerists of immaterial goods? Do we perhaps stuff ourselves with knowledge in order to grow tall and strong before men, unaware that our gluttonous vanity is making us morbidly obese?

How can we learn wisdom by a reflective practice, not by a mad hoarding?
