> Quin ex corporeo sensu propius adhuc discernere licet quantum in aestimandis animae virtutibus hallucinemur. Nam si vel terram despicimus medio die, vel intuemur quae aspectui nostro circumcirca patent, validissima perspicacissimaque acie videmur nobis praediti: at ubi in solem suspicimus, atque arrectis oculis contemplamur, vis illa quae egregie in terra valebat, tanto fulgore protinus perstringitur et confunditur, ut fateri cogamur, illud nostrum in considerandis terrenis acumen, ubi ad solem ventum est, meram esse hebetudinem. Ita et in reputandis spiritualibus nostris bonis contingit; quantisper enim extra terram non respicimus, propria iustitia, sapientia, virtute pulchre contenti, nobis suavissime blandimur, et tantum non semidei videmur; at si semel coeperimus cogitationem in Deum erigere, et expendere qualis sit, et quam exacta iustitiae, sapientiae, virtutis eius perfectio, ad cuius amussim conformari nos oportet: quod antea in nobis falso iustitiae praetextu arridebat, pro summa iniquitate mox sordescet: quod mirifice imponebat sapientiae titulo, pro extrema stultitia foetebit: quod virtutis faciem prae se ferebat, miserrima impotentia esse arguetur: adeo divinae puritati male respondet quod videtur in nobis vel absolutissimum. (1.1.2)

> We can see more clearly how much we're deluded in our self-judged virtues through sight itself: at midday when we look at the ground or what's around us, we seem to have excellent vision. But when we look up at the sun, our vision that worked so well on the ground is quickly overwhelmed, so that we have to confess that our sense that seemed so perceptive on earth is completely dull when confronted with the sun. It is the same in judging our spiritual state: as long as we don't look beyond the earth, we'll flatter ourselves complacently on our fairness, our smartness, and our niceness, and we'll seem almost like gods. But as soon as we raise our thoughts up to God and consider what *he* is like, how pure are *his* justice, wisdom, and goodness—a high bar for us to reach!—after we look upward like this, all that niceness that pleased us in ourselves will seem like rotten garbage, all that smartness will reek of foolishness, and all that fairness will be exposed as nothing but weakness. So it is that what seems the very best in us pales before the true goodness of God.

The striking imagery continues. Also, these reflections on human nature apply to us as modern society as much as to us as individuals. We moderns are pleased with our fairness, our cleverness, and our niceness, but we are pleased with inferior virtues. How can we recover a fuller sense of virtue and live it out in our enervated times?
