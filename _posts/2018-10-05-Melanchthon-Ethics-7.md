*Quid est virtus? / What is virtue?*
*De disciplina / On discipline*

> Non igitur negligamus disciplinam, sed sciamus divinitus praecipi, ut simus intenti, nec laxemus frenos vitiosis cupiditatibus. Qui volens alit incendia vitiorum admissis illecebris, turbat Spiritum sanctum, nec expetit se gubernari a Spiritu sancto, cum ipse contrarium faciat. Postulatur enim et nostra diligentia, ut Paulus inquit ad Ephesios. *Ambulate accurate, non ut fatui, sed ut sapientes,* etc. Cum enim inquit accurate, praecipit ut sint in nobis cogitatio, intentio, cura, et conatus reprimendi vitiosos impetus. Et ad hanc circumspectionem et ad conatum nostrum accedat invocatio Dei, sicut infra rursus dicemus. Et Paulus de sese iam senex inquit, *Sugillo corpus meum et in servitutem redigo, ne cum alios doceam, ipse fiam reprobus.*

> So let's not neglect discipline, but remember that God warns us to be disciplined so that we're focused, not letting down our guard against bad desires. If we intentionally fan the flames of vice by allowing ourselves pleasures that tempt us further, we work against the Holy Spirit. Our own hard work is key, as Paul says to the Ephesians: "Walk carefully, not unthinkingly, but wisely," etc. When he says "carefully" he is warning us to think, to tighten up, to sweat, to try hard to restrain bad urges. Once we have this caution and effort, then let us also call upon God. Even Paul as an old man says of himself, "I beat my body and force it into servitude, so that I don't slip into bad conduct while teaching others." 

What if we re-read Paul with an eye out to the disciplined cultivation of virtue, not just (as usual) grace over works?
