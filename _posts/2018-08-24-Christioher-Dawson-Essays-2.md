> Thus each of the new religio-philosophic traditions [that developed in the middle of the first millennium B.C.] -- Brahmanism, Buddhism, Taoism, and Platonism -- ultimately transcends philosophy and culminates in mysticism. They are not satisfied with the demonstration of the Absolute; they demand the experience of the Absolute also, whether it be the vision of the Essential Good and the Essential Beauty, through which the soul is made deiform, or that intuition of the nothingness and illusion inherent in all contingent being which renders a man jivana mukti, "delivered alive." But how is such an experience conceivable? It seems to be a contradiction in terms -- to know the Unknowable, to grasp the Incomprehensible, to receive the Infinite, Certainly it transcends the categories of human thought and the normal conditions of human experience. Yet it has remained for thousands of years as the goal--whether attainable or unattainable -- of the religious life; and no religion which ignores this aspiration can prove permanently satisfying to man's spiritual needs. The whole religious experience of mankind indeed, the very existence of religion itself testifies, not only to a sense of the Transcendent, but to an appetite for the Transcendent that can only be satisfied by immediate contact -- by a vision of the supreme Reality. It is the goal of the intellect as well as of the will, for, as a Belgian philosopher has said, "The human mind is a faculty in quest of its intuition, that is to say, of assimilation with Being" and it is "perpetually chased from the movable, manifold and deficient towards the Absolute, the One and the Infinite, that is, towards Being pure and simple."

How can we experience the Transcendent embodied around us, how are we to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living? Embodied, because we can't count on direct, mystical encounters with God, which are a gift and not a technique. And yet if we are to have these encounters, we find them through the embodied forms of the Transcendent: beautiful art, a sacrifice made by a loved one, music, a sunset, big ideas sublimely expressed -- as happened with me once as I read Augustine's Confessions. How can we manifest this embodied transcendence in our life, and for those around us? What habits can we cultivate to be more alert to these moments, to foster them in our daily routine, to create them in our interactions with others?
