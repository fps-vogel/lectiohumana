> Another relationship exists between technique and the machine, and this relationship penetrates to the very core of the problem of our civilization. It is said (and everyone agrees) that the machine has created an inhuman atmosphere. The machine, so characteristic of the nineteenth century, made an abrupt entrance into a society which, from the political, institutional, and human points of view, was not made to receive it; and man has had to put up with it as best he can. Men now live in conditions that are less than human. Consider the concentration of our great cities, the slums, the lack of space, of air, of time, the gloomy streets and the sallow lights that confuse night and day. Think of our dehumanized factories, our unsatisfied senses, our working women, our estrangement from nature. Life in such an environment has no meaning. Consider our public transportation, in which man is less important than a parcel; our hospitals, in which he is only a number. Yet we call this progress. ... And the noise, that monster boring into us at every hour of the night without respite.

How can we humanize systems that we see are dehumanizing? Much is bureaucratized beyond our reach to change, but we can reach through even the densest set of procedures, out to a human being in front of us, if only we work hard to *see* people as individuals, and then to treat them so as to bring out their individuality rather than repress it.
