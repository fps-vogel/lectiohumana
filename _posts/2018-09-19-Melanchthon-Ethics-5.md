*Quaestio haec sit: An virtus sit finis hominis, an vero voluptas? / Let us investigate whether our purpose is virtue, or pleasure and entertainment.*

*Secundum. / Second:*

> (a) Quaelibet natura recto et ordinato appetitu, praecipue appetit conservationem sui. (b) Voluptas est conservatio naturae hominis, virtus destructio, ut in Socrate et similibus apparet, qui propter recte facta interficiuntur. (c) Ergo voluptas est finis, non virtus.
{:.latin}

> Nego minorem, et ratio est, quia est fallacia accidentis. Nam quod virtus destruit naturam, id fit per accidens. Quod Socrates interficitur, causa est non virtus in Socrate, sed iniustitia inimicorum. ... Praeterea universaliter verum est, virtute servari speciem. Veritas, iustitia, fortitudo, prosunt universae societati, etiamsi individuum in praesentia destruitur. Plus est autem servari totum quam partem.

> (a) Every being naturally aims at its own survival. (b) We feel pleasure as a signal that we're doing well at surviving, but virtue often leads to death, as in the case of Socrates and others who were killed because of their well-doing. (c) Therefore, pleasure is our purpose, not virtue.

> I deny the minor premise because it's not virtue's fault that it's dangerous. Socrates was killed not because of his virtue, but because of the corruption of his enemies. ... Also, it's always true that the species is saved by virtue. An individual's honesty, justice, and courage are good for all of society, even if consequently the individual is killed. It is better for the whole to be saved, than just a part.

Are we aiming to live well for ourselves only, or for the good of those around us? Are we tending only to our own garden, or making the forest more beautiful also? This means putting ourselves in danger or discomfort.

> Refutata minore, deinde etiam neganda est maior. Non est vera propositio: Quamlibet naturam maxime appetere conservationem, tantum ut sit. Sed illa vera est, ordinate appetere omnes, ut sint incolumes in tali statu, ad quem natura condita est. Nam et in eo statu natura vere conservari potest. Sed cum vagatur appetitio sine ordine, non sequitur conclusio de fine, quia inordinata appetitio, etiam contraria naturae appetit. Praeteria incolumitas, quae sic vocari potest, non debet esse destructio, vel individui, vel speciei. Etsi itigur aliquantisper est incolumis Nero, tamen dolor conscientiae scelerum, destructio est, qui non potest non sequi. Et Diabolus magis optat non esse quam sic esse. Immo horribiliter dolet, se non posse abrumpere miseriam, redingendo sese in nihilum, et de Iuda tristissimum dictum est: *Melius ei esset, natum non esse.* Cum igitur maior non sit vera, sequitur conclusio falsa. Sic enim in maiori dicendum erat: Quaelibet natura recto et ordinato appetitu, maxime appetit conservationem sui in tali statu, ad quem condita est.

> I also deny the major premise. We don't aim at survival only to continue existing. We strive for the state of being that we were made for, the state in which we flourish. But when our attention jumps from one thing to another following no fixed principle, we can't conclude anything about our ultimate purpose because we often do the opposite of what leads to flourishing. Besides, this well-being cannot be self-destruction, which is exactly what Nero suffered by his tortured conscience, Satan by his loathing of everything, and Judas by his suicide. And yet all these followed their pleasure. So we mustn't merely behave in whatever way to comfortably survive, but we must strive for that place where we flourish.

And yet the greatest danger is in not living virtuously, uncomfortably, dangerously for the highest good: because then our spirit starves, and starves others' spirits also.
