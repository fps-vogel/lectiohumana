> Now the great obstacle to the attainment of a purely rational system of ethics is simply our lack of knowledge of Reality. ... There is continual movement from the Known to the Unknown. Something that was not before, has come to be. Granted that the true morality is that which subserves Progress, how can we know what it is that will best serve the Unknown? Could Aurignacian man divine the coming of civilization? Could the men of the Mycenean age foresee Hellenism? When the people of Israel came raiding into Canaan, could they look forward to the future of Judaism? And yet all these achievements were in some degree implicit in the beginnings of these peoples. They created what they could not understand. If they had limited themselves to the observance of a purely rational social ethic based on the immediate advantage of the community, they might have been more prosperous, but they would not have been culturally creative. They would have had no importance for the future. The highest moral ideal either for a people or for an individual is to be true to its destiny, to sacrifice the bird in the hand for the vision in the bush, to leave the known for the unknown, like Abram going out from Harran and from his own people, obedient to the call of Yahweh, or the Aeneas of Virgil's great religious epic. (Civilization and Morals)

Was it right for Abram to take his dependents away from their home and their family? Surely not, they must have lamented as they wandered in foreign lands. The stakes for us are usually lower: merely a sacrifice of comfort, of familiarity, perhaps of outward success in some field. A small risk, considering the cost of clinging to the Known: regret at not following a wider and deeper vision, the slow death of our spirit as our lost vision becomes a haunting nightmare, and in the daytime we close our eyes and try to ignore the weight of our forsaken destiny and the bitterness of our unrealized potential.

Let us remember this, if we have set out for the Unknown and wonder whether we chose rightly.
