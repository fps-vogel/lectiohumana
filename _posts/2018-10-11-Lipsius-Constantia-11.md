> Litterae tibi hactenus cordi, et novem istae deae? Placet. Scio enim amoeniore hac et externa doctrina excoli et praeparari prius animum debere, *non ante idoneum cui divina semina commitantur.* Sed illud non placet, si in his adhaerescis, eaque una tibi studiorum, quod dicitur, prora et puppis. Rudimenta enim haec nostra esse debent, non opera: via, non meta. In convivio aliquo si assedisses, non bellaria solum et placentas gustares, credo: sed stomacho fulcimentum aliquod dares cibi firmioris: in hoc publico doctrinarum epulo, cur non idem fit? Cur, inquam, ad illa oratorum et poetarum mella, non adiungis hanc firmiorem Philosophiae dapem? Non enim deseri illas volo (ne tacitus me calumniere) sed hanc adferi. ... Pulchra haec laudatio, O virum doctum! Sed illa melior, O virum sapientem! Et ista optima, O virum bonum! Has sectemur: et per tot labore non Scire tantum velimus, sed Sapere et Facere. Ὡς οὐδέν ἡ μάθησις, ἂν μὴ νοῦς παρῇ! ait vetus et verus versus.

> Do you love literature and the nine Muses? Good. I know that without these pleasant pursuits, "no mind is ready to be sown with divine seeds," as Augustine says. But it's not good if you love these studies so much that you get stuck in them. They should be the foundation for us, not the summit; the road, not the end goal. If you were at a dinner party, you wouldn't eat only appetizers and candies, but you'd want to fill your belly with a meal. In feeding ourselves with learning, why shouldn't it be the same? To the sweets of literature why don't you add the nutrition of philosophy? I don't mean you should abandon everything else, but add on to what you've learned. ... It's great to be called knowledgeable, but it's better to be called wise, and best to be called good. So let us pursue these last two, and seek not only to know, but to be wise, and to act wisely. As in an old and true verse of Menander, "Education is nothing, if it has no wisdom."

In our career, in our specialization, in our "passion," how can we not lose sight of living wisely?
