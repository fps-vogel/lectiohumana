Many communities are based around beliefs held in common: political parties and churches, for example. But often these beliefs become not the honest conviction of individuals, but simply a means of participation in the group, a token that you're in. Or as Peterson would say, the language concerning these beliefs becomes instrumental. And so the beliefs ossify as fewer and fewer members think about them, the living tradition becomes dead, and members relax in the shade of a set of ready-made answers to life, now and then manipulated by a clever person who uses the group's beliefs to gain trust with them and power for its own sake.

Instead of re-enacting the Fall like this, why not be honest with ourselves and with others, and listen to each other without taking original thought as a malevolence? Rather than taking the party line as the highest good and anything contrary to it as an attack, why not be open to revision and open to learning the good anew together? "Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."
