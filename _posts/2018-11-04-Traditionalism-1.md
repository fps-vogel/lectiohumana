Choice excerpts from *Traditionalism* by Kenneth Oldmeadow. The Traditionalists, who are new to me, seem to offer a wonderful alternative to the current dichotomy between the scientific and literalist religious worldviews, where to be an intelligent person many feel like they have to abandon their religious tradition, or at least reinterpret it to death. The world of symbol, the esoteric, the value of other cultures, an incisive critique of modernityâ€”all these are opened up by this school of thinkers. Here are some outstanding quotes.

On the value of traditional cultures:

> Religious civilizations ... are ... like sea-walls built to stem the rising tide of worldliness, of error, of subversion, of the fall and its perpetual renewal. ... The rejection of the traditional religious frameworks amounts to an assertion that the founders of religion did not know what they were doing, as well as that abuses are not inherent in human nature, and that they are therefore avoidable even in societies counting millions of men, and that they are avoidable through purely human means; no more flagrant contradiction than this could be imagined. (Schuon, quoted p. 67)

On a divinely revealed orthodoxy:

> Intellection [i.e. the experience of God] has need of tradition, of a Revelation fixed in time and adapted to a society, if it is to be awakened in us and not go astray ... the importance of orthodoxy, of tradition, of Revelation is that the means of realising the Absolute must come 'objectively' from the Absolute; knowledge cannot spring up 'subjectively] except within the framework of an 'objective' divine formulation of Knowledge. (Schuon, quoted p. 95)

On the necessity of faith:

> One can meditate or speculate indefinitely on transcendent truths and their applications ... One can spend a whole lifetime speculating on the suprasensorial and the transcendent, but all that matters is the 'leap into the void' which is the fixation of spirit and soul in an unthinkable dimension of the Real ... this 'leap into the void' we can call ... 'faith.' (Schuon, quoted p. 96)

Schuon considers the relationships between truth, goodness, and beauty, often in discussions of sacred art (p. 107). Likewise, Oldmeadow on Coomaraswamy: "[In the modern West] A sense of beauty has become not a matter of truths but of tastes and the 'emancipation of the artist' is nothing other than the 'freedom' to ignore the claims of any ideal higher than 'self-expression'." Coomaraswamy again: "Our 'aesthetic approach' can be compared only to that of a traveller who, when he sees a signpost, proceeds to admire its elegance, asks who made it, and finally cuts it down and takes it home to be used as a mantelpiece ornament." (107)

Against secular humanism:

> To say that man is the measure of all things is meaningless unless one starts from the idea that God is the measure of man ... Nothing is fully human that is not determined by the Divine, and therefore centered on it. Once man makes of himself a measure, while refusing to be measured in turn ... all human landmarks disappear; once cut off from the Divine, the human collapses. (Schuon, quoted p. 138)

On evolutionism:

> Opinions now current prove that people think themselves incomparably more 'realistic' than anyone has ever been, even in the recent past. What we call 'our own times' or 'the twentieth century' or 'the atomic age' seems to hover, like an uprooted island or a fabulously clear-headed monad, above millennia of childishness and fecklessness. The contemporary world is like a man ashamed of having had parents and wanting to create himself, and to recreate space, time and all physical laws as well, and seeking to extract from nothing a world objectively perfect and subjectively comfortable, and all this by means of a creative activity independent of God. The unfortunate thing is that attempts to create a new order of Being can only end in self-destruction. (Schuon, quoted p. 139)

Against evolutionism again:

> The ontological situation of man in the total scheme of things is always the same. (Nasr, quoted p. 148)

The traditionalists point to divine truth in several religious traditions, but at the same time they despise New Age and similar hodgepodges of spirituality. Of Alan Watts and other "pop gurus" Schuon says that they show "the disordered subjectivism of a personal mysticism." (p. 146)

Nor do the traditionalists ask that people in the West practice Eastern religions:

> What we have in mind, for the Christian, is a return to his own sources, and not an 'orientalisation' of the West. (Schuon, quoted p. 170)

In view of these thoughts, how can we delve deeper into our tradition? Listening to Jonathan Pageau lately has given me a new taste of the tradition of symbolic biblical interpretation. I have read some of Calvin's Institutes; I will give it another try because the Reformed tradition is the most formidable among the Protestants.
