> Everyone has been taught that technique is an application of science; more particularly (science being pure speculation), technique figures as the point of contact between material reality and the scientific formula. But it also appears as the practical product, the application of the formulas to practical life. This traditional view is radically false. (7)

> Today all scientific research presupposes enormous technical preparations (as, for example, in atomic research). And very often it is some simple technical modification which allows further scientific progress. (8)

> ... scientific activity has been superseded by technical activity to such a degree that we can no longer conceive of science without its technical outcome. (9)

> The scientist is no longer able to hold out: "Even science, especially the magnificent science of our own day, has become an element of technique, a mere means." (Mauss). There we have, indeed, the final word: science has become an instrument of technique. ... Indeed, our omnivorous technique (and this represents in part Einstein's thought) may in the end make science sterile. (10)

How can we be on our guard against letting all our learning and creativity be driven by utilitarian ends? I often feel a pull toward spending my creative energy in ways that will boost my resume and possibly garner attention and admiration. Even this blog is not free of that motivation. But writing here also has the useful effect of pushing me to read thoughtfully every day. Not every self-seeking endeavor that comes to my mind is good for me like that.

But how can we go further than what is incidentally nourishing? How can we push ourselves to learn purely, not to further our worldly success but to help us to live wisely? How can we bring ourselves to true contemplation, not to dissect a thing to appear intelligent but to gaze at it in self-forgetting wonder?
