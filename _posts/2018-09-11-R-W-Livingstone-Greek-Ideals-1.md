> Two hundred years hence our own age may be regarded as one that possessed, for its time, considerable material civilization but very little else, a substantial body and a soul which died from fatty degeneration. The real cause of our *malaise* is the absence of what Huxley (afraid of the word 'spiritual') called an 'ethical ideal'. This explains, if not the disease, the difficulty of curing it. We do not know what we believe; therefore we do not know what we want. So we succumb to heady emotions, like nationalism, fascism, communism, militarism, pacifism. (Of course all of these may be rational convictions; but more frequently they are emotional disturbances.) 'L'esprit croit naturellement et la volonté  aime naturellement; de sorte que, faute de vrais objets, il faut qu'ils s'attachent aux faux' (Pascal, *Pensées*, 81). We become the slaves of our material civilization and not its masters. No steady wind of purpose fills the sails of our ship. The modern world has no definite view of life. Christianity, though still a living religion and, even with those who reject it, a powerful influence, is no longer the creed of Europe, and nothing has taken its place. The majority of men have exchanged the certainty of faith for a twilight of opinion. Here the pagan world was better provided than the twentieth century. It had at least the two great ethical creeds of Stoicism and Epicureanism by which men could anchor their lives and ride out whatever storms might come.

How can we exercise our soul, even we who do hold to a spiritual ideal? Because we are, almost as much as anyone, surrounded by a spiritually poor civilization. What habits can we cultivate in order to counteract the drain from this spiritual poverty?
