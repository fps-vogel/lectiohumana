> Modern man at first sought to conquer nature. With the coming of the Industrial Revolution, which inaugurated the reign of the machine, he has succeeded in conquering nature to a degree never before imagined. Even those who today live in relatively modest comfort exceed by far the luxuries of the past. But modern man has paid a high price for these comforts: he has been conquered by the machine. This has resulted in his substituting economic means for the spiritual ends of life. Thus the machine has done much to destroy the highest aspects of human personality; for modern man has become a helpless victim of mass propaganda, his inner strength sapped by his insidious desire for comfort and security, so that he is willing to surrender his spiritual freedom and integrity for these lesser goods. He is selling his birthright for a mess of pottage. As Berdyaev, who spent a lifetime vividly portraying these dangers, once wrote: "We are now passing through the painful agony of an individualism devoid of all spiritual foundation."

Let us examine our lives and mark out those lesser goods that we continue to pursue. How can we train ourselves and teach those around us to set our sights higher? That is the ultimate aim of what we call education: to train our desires and equip our minds to do good, and ever to seek to do better.
