*Quid est virtus? / What is virtue?*

> Virtus est habitus, inclinans voluntatem ad obediendum rectae rationi. ... Cum enim homo conditus sit, ut sit imago Dei, Deus immensa bonitate praecipuarum et optimarum rerum in sua substantia similitudinem in nobis condidit, scilicet, similem legis sapientiam, libertatem in voluntate, et virtutes. Ad haec transfudit in primos homines Spiritum sanctum, impertiens suae essentiae societatem. Haec dona voluit testimonium esse magni et veri amoris erga nos. Hunc amorem agnoscere nos oportebat, et vicissim Deum diligere.
{:.latin}

> Etsi autem post depravationem naturae, ingens et tristis imbecillitas secuta est, tamen et mens retinet insitas notitias, et voluntas aliquam libertatem, quia Deus vult lucere in nobis testimonia, quod sit, qualis sit, et quod iudicaturus sit, et vult disciplinam commonefactionem esse de ipso. Quare iudicium ideo rectum dicitur, quia notitiae congruunt cum aeterna et immota Dei mente, et tunc voluntas bona est, quando cum illa norma mentis divinae congruit.
{:.latin}

> Virtue is a disposition that spurs our desire toward obeying right reason. ... When humans were created to be the image of God, God in his immense goodness created us similar to himself in fundamental ways: that is, he put in us a knowledge of divine law, freedom of the will, and many powers to effect our will: learning, creating, reasoning, and so forth. Further, he poured the Holy Spirit into the first humans, so that they would always be in contact with him. God meant these gifts as a token of his love toward us. We, in turn, were to recognize this love and love God in return.

> Although after the Fall we were pitifully weakened, our mind nevertheless still has those primordial ideas of God, and our will still has some of its freedom, because God wants those to shine in us as proofs of who he is, what he's like, and how he will judge us, and he wants all our learning to be a reminder of himself. And so "sound judgment" is aptly named because by it we mean the soundness of those primordial ideas in harmony with the eternal and changeless mind of God. Then also we aptly say "goodwill" because our will is good when it lines up with God's rule and squares with his norm of goodness.

*Vult disciplinam commonefactionem esse de ipso,* God wants all our learning to be a reminder of himself. Perhaps Plato wasn't far off the mark with his anamnesis.

How can we direct our learning not further afield but closer and closer to our lost home, to paradise, so that we can then come closer in our actions to restoring it?
