> Si quis deus sponsor tibi per hoc ipsum bellum sit, agellos tuos intactos fore, domum pecuniamque salvam, teipsum in monte aliquo constituat velatum Homerica nube: etiamne dolebis? De te quidem hoc non ausim dicere, sed erit non nemo qui gaudebit etiam, et oculos suos avide pascet in confusa illa morientium strage. Quid abnuis, aut miraris? Ita insita nescio quae malitia humani ingenii fert, *Laetans,* ut poeta vetus loquitur, *malo alieno.* Atque ut poma quaedam gustu suaviter acerba sunt: sic alienae curae, securis nobis. Pone mihi aliquem in Oceani illo littore, qui naufragium spectet. Afficietur sane, sed non iniucundo quodam animi morsu: quia aliena pericula videt, sine suo. At repone eundem in iactata illa navi: dolebit scilicet alium dolorem.

> Suppose some god becomes your protector in that war, so that your land is untouched, your house and your money safe, and you yourself are placed on a mountain veiled by a cloud, as in Homer. Would you still be sad? I'm not saying this about you, but there are some people who would be overjoyed in that situation, as they looked over the ruin and destruction below with wide eyes. Why are you shaking your head in disbelief? Remember the mysterious evil in human nature that, as the poet says, "Rejoices at the misfortunes of others." As the bitter taste of some fruits is sweet in our mouth, so another's hardship is to us in prosperity. Consider a person who watches a shipwreck from shore: it will affect him, of course, but with a not unpleasant distress, since he sees the danger of others, not his own. But put that person in the sinking ship, and he will surely feel another kind of distress.

When we lament the way that the world is, how we wish we could do X for a living or live near Y or get away from Z if only society were more sane and human, let us not look for a solution for ourselves only, but continue to work to fix broken society. *But there's no hope,* we might say, *Better to find my corner and live happily than to pour out my life on desert ground, fruitlessly and miserably.* Better? More pleasant in a way, but less satisfying considering your conscience stinging from your cowardice, from your running away from the battle. Live fruitlessly and miserably, so long as you don't give up on your ideals and on seeing the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. And besides, who can judge the fruit of their life?
