> Nam primo, se nemo aspicere potest quin ad Dei, *in quo vivit et movetur,* intuitum sensus suos protinus convertat: quia minime obscurum est, dotes quibus pollemus, nequaquam a nobis esse. Immo ne id quidem ipsum quod sumus, aliud esse quam in uno Deo subsistentiam. Deinde ab his bonis quae guttatim a caelo ad nos stillant, tamquam a rivulis ad fontem deducimur. (1.1.1)
{:.latin}

> First of all, if we look at ourselves, it's not long before we turn our gaze to God, "in whom we live and have our being," because it's clear as day that our amazing human abilities are not at all from us. No, not even our very being is anything but existence rooted in the one God. But all these good things that we see in us are but droplets from heaven, and they lead us upward as if we're following little streams up to the gushing spring.

> Iam vero ex nostra tenuitate melius apparet illa, quae in Deo residet, bonorum infinitas. Praesertim miserabilis haec ruina, in quam nos deiecit primi hominis defectio, sursum oculos cogit attollere, non modo ut inde ieiuni et famelici petamus quod nobis deest, sed metu expergefacti, humilitatem discamus. Nam ut in homine reperitur quidam miseriarum omnium mundus, ac ex quo spoliati sumus divino ornatu, pudenda nuditas immensam probrorum congeriem detegit. (1.1.1)
{:.latin}

> But that boundless good that has its home in God is even more clearly seen from our poverty. Now that we find ourselves in a pitiful ruin, cast down by the first man's rebellion, our eyes are forced upward, to that place where we seek what we've lost, what we now hunger and thirst forâ€”but in those upward reaches we no less are terrified and learn humility, since that light exposes deformity and rottenness of which we've been ashamed ever since we were robbed of our divine dress. Now we are naked, and in us is a world of endless miseries.

Calvin's imagery is striking: downward and upward, droplets and a mighty stream, ruin and pristine beauty, darkness and light, hideous and stinking corruption and perfect bodies divinely dressed.

How can we make sure that we think not only in abstract propositions, but in images? How can we translate our too-wordy concepts into concrete spaces and stories in our mind? The Scriptures give us an excellent blueprint for this.

Is this the meaning of the "moral imagination"?
