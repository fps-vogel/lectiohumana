> Amas certe Lipsi, inquit, amas floridam hanc purpureamque Nympham: sed vereor, ut ames immodeste. Hortos enim laudas, sed ita ut vana pleraque in iis mirere, aut externa: vera et legitima eorum gaudia omittas. Colores enim duntaxat avide inspicis, et in pulvillis quiescis, et flores petis ab noto ignotoque orbe. Obsecro ut quid? Ut ne te quoque esse sciam in hac secta, quae exorta hodie, male curiosorum hominum, male feriatorum? Qui rem optimam simplicissimamque, instrumentum duorum vitiorum fecerunt, Vanitatis et Torporis. Hac enim fini habent hortos. Herbulas aliquot et flores exoticos ambitiose conquirunt: et quaesitos ita anxie fovent et tuentur, ut nulla mater suum gnatum. Hi sunt, quorum litterae in Thraciam, Graeciam, Indiam discurrunt: idque seminis exigui aut bulbuli causa. Hi, quibus aegrius sit florem aliquem novum mori, quam veterem amicum. Romanum illum riserit aliquis, qui piscem suum atratus luxit? Isti plantam. Iam si quis ex his Florae candidatis novius aliquid aut rarius nactus est, ut ostentat! Ut alii competitores aemulantur, invident! E quibus non tristior domum discedit, quam olim in Praeturae petitione victus Sulla aut Marcellus. Quid dicam? nisi hilaram hanc quandam insaniam esse: nec absimilem illi puerorum, pallentium et rixantium circa pupas suas et sigilla? At eorundem industriam in hortis etiam cognosce. Sedent, circumambulant, oscitant, dormiunt. Prorsus ut non otii sui secessum hunc habeant, sed desidiae sepulcrum. Profanum genus! Et quos iure arceam ab orgiis veri arcanique horti.

> [Lipsius has just praised the hobby of gardening at great length, and now Lang replies.] Clearly you're in love with the spirit of the flower garden, but, I'm afraid, you're in the wrong kind of love. You adore the garden's appearance, ignoring its real joys. You love to lie on cushions rapturously gazing at the colors of all kinds of flowers. Obviously you're one of those restless loungers who don't know how to use their time well, who take good thing like gardening and make it into a channel of vice, specifically of vanity and laziness. They get into gardening for all the wrong reasons. They procure exotic flowers from all over, and once they've found a new one they sweat and worry over it like no mother does with her child. They send letters all over Thrace, Greece, and India looking for some little seed or bulb. They grieve more if some new flower dies, than over the death of an old friend. Do you know the story of the Roman who dressed in black to mourn his dead fish? Well, these people are the same with their flowers. Whenever one of these worshippers of Flora finds something new or rare, how he shows it off! How the other gardeners go green with jealousy! They walk out of their houses more dejected than Sulla or Marcellus when they lost an election. I can only call all this a ridiculous kind of insanity, where adults act like children who fight over their toys. But look at the diligence of these gardeners! They sit, walk around, yawn, sleep. It's as if the garden is not a refuge for rest, but a grave for wasting their lives. Despicable! From such people I hide the rites of the true garden.

How are we using our free time like these gardeners?
