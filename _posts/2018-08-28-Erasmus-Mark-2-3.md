> Inutilis est mixtura rerum sibi non congruentium. Nullus enim sic desipit, ut si vestem veterem sarcire cupiat, assuat fragmentum panni novi. Cur ita? Nempe quia videt futurum, ut si id faciat, et novi panni iacturam faciat, et vetustae vestis plagam reddat maiorem. Siquidem offensus insigni dissimilitudine panni assuti, et vestis male sartae, continuo detrahit quod assuerat: itaque ruptura vestis antiquae turpius hiat quam antea. Neque quisquam tam stultus est, ut vinum novum credat utribus antiquis. Quamobrem? Quia videt fore duplicem iacturam. Nam mustum ob vehementiam spirituum effervescens, disrumpit utres ob vetustatem imbecilles, itaque simul pereunt et utres et vinum. (21-22)

> It's useless to mix things that don't go together. No one is so senseless as to fix an old piece of clothing by sewing on a patch of new fabric. Why? Because he knows that if he does this, not only will the new patch be wasted, but the hole in the old clothing will grow even bigger. That's because when he's dissatisfied with the odd contrast between the new patch and the old cloth, he'll right away remove the patch, which will widen the hole in the old cloth. Nor is anyone so stupid as to put new wine in old wineskins. Why? Because he sees that it'll be a waste of both. Because the new wine is still fermenting, it bursts the old and weak wineskins, and so both go to waste.

What conflicting things are we putting together in our life? Have we taken new directions but left some of the old in our daily routine, in our habits, in our cravings and desires? Are we disgusted at our old way of life, but blind to all the islands of that life that still lurk in the things we do and think even now? Take hold of the new and better life, not dipping our toes in but practicing it all the time until we're exhausted, then doing the same the next day, and letting nothing that we do go unexamined and untested against our ideals.
