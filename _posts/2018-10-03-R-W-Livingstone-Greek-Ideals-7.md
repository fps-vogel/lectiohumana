> Palestine then conceived God as a person, formed a clear idea of his character and purposes, an, inevitably, placed religion in the centre of life as the greatest of all interests. This had a speculative and a practical result. Speculatively, it drove the invisible world into the foreground. It filled men with the sense that behind the shows of life there existed an ultimate reality, which must hold the key to their destiny and the clue to right conduct. It insisted that the things which are seen are temporal and that the things which are not seen are eternal. That is the truth which Palestine grasped more tenaciously and testified more insistently than Greece. In a sense she grasps and testifies nothing else. At its worst this conviction led to a narrowness and bigotry from which Hellenism is free; but it redeemed men from any easy, self-contented superficiality in their view of life. ... There is justice in Carlyle's complaint that Socrates was 'too much at ease in Zion'. Being 'too much at ease in Zion' is a defect, in a far more aggravated form, of our age, which lives in the visible and external world more entirely than any of its predecessors, has time for little else, and has so far mastered it as to forget that the known is still nothing in comparison with the unknown and that for all our discoveries and material triumphs Zion remains infinitely mysterious. Palestine prevents men from being too much at ease in Zion, or forgetting it exists.

It seems that we only aim higher toward God consistently, inasmuch as we are periodically jarred from whatever comfortable trajectory to which we've settled down. What can we do daily to prevent ourselves from being "too much at ease in Zion"?
