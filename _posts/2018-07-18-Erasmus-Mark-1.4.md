> Satanae mundique spiritus reddit et amat animos elatos, tumidos, feroces: at Spiritus ille coelestis amat modestos, mites ac tranquillos. Nihil enim columba simplicius, aut a pugna raptuque alienius. (1.10)

> The spirit of Satan and the world loves lofty, puffed up, ferocious minds, and makes them so. But that heavenly Spirit loves moderate, gentle, and calm minds. Nothing is more simple than a dove, or more unlike war and plunder.

As we often hear of good Christians, though we rarely try to be at peace. On the other hand...

> Non est ignavus aut languidus Spiritus ille coelestis, igneus est; ac statim vim suam exserit, ubi semel corripuerit animum hominis: segnis ac lentus est spiritus humanus, neque quidquam cogitat, nisi terrena et humilia. Ceterum in quibus iam mortificatus est spiritus carnis, et aguntur Spiritu Dei, mox ad fortia sublimiaque grassantur, ad certamen cum immundo Spiritu, quem non dubitant in se provocare: nimirum freti praesidio Spiritus coelestis, qui fortior est omnibus qui repugnant Evangelio. Iesus igitur in se exprimens, quid a nobis fieri vellet, statim a baptismo Spiritus vigore actus est in desertum. (1.12)

> That heavenly Spirit is not cowardly or weak, but rages like fire: and once it's taken hold of our mind, it shakes us up with a mighty shock. The human spirit is lazy and slow, thinking of nothing but low and earthly things. But when our flesh-and-blood spirit is killed and we are led by the Spirit of God, soon we will storm high things and strong, before arming ourselves with them and calling out the impure spirit to battle with us, energized and set ablaze by the heavenly Spirit which overwhelms any force that fights against the power of Christ. For Jesus showed in himself what he wants of us, when immediately after his baptism he was impelled by the Spirit to the desert.

Real power comes only through power's renunciation. We are always jumping into the fray with bodies bloated by our grasping, devouring pride; with arms and legs crippled by the leeches that we've let suck our life away. Let us leave our battles and go down to the river, once again to be washed and cleansed by water, to come up and see the heavens open up and purify us with the fire that gives life. Then we will be tall, beautiful, muscular, fiery-eyed and clad in shining armor for the battle against the dark spirits that fed on us and are rushing back to retake our bodies. Take the strong and high places! Arm for battle, the only battle.
