> Consequently if we rely on history alone we can never hope to transcend the sphere of relativity; it is only in religion and metaphysics that we can find truths that claim absolute and eternal validity. But as we have said, non-Christian and pre-Christian philosophy tend to solve the problem of history by a radical denial of its significance. The world of true Being which is man's spiritual home is the world that knows no change. The world of time and change is the material world from which man must escape if he would be saved. For all the works of men and the rise and fall of kingdoms are but the fruits of ignorance and lust—*mala vitae cupido*—and even the masters of the world must recognize in the end the vanity of their labours like the great Shogun Hideyoshi who wrote on his deathbed:

> Alas, as the grass I fade 
As the dew I vanish 
Even Osaka Castle 
Is a dream within a dream. 

> Yet even the religion that denies the significance of history is itself a part of history and it can only survive in so far as it embodies itself in a social tradition and thus "makes history."

On the other hand, there is always a dualistic, gnosticising force within Christianity. Turn on Christian radio, and you're sure to hear a lot about the vanity of worldly things, a lot of "only Jesus", but very little about spirituality embodied in tradition, faith realized in history apart from the gospel event itself.

How can we cultivate a more embodied art, and live within a more historically rich tradition? Jonathan Pageau is giving me some ideas in his symbolic approach to Christian art, Scripture, and life.
