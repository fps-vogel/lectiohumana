> Human society today is in a state of rapid change. ... The new social forms offer new opportunities—new openings for the action of grace. We are perhaps too much inclined to look to authority to lay down beforehand a programme of action when the initiative must come in the first place from the spontaneous personal reaction of individuals to the circumstances of the moment. Even in the natural sphere the statesmen and organizers of this world do not know what is going to happen from one day to another. But whereas this obscurity and incalculability is inevitably a source of discouragement to the statesman, whose whole business is to achieve temporal success, it should be of no great importance to the Christian who sees the end of history as dawn and not as night. When Our Lord spoke of the future He gave His disciples no optimistic hopes, no visions of social progress; He described all the things that we are afraid of today and more—wars, persecutions, disasters and the distress of nations. But strange to say He used this forecast of calamity as a motive for hope. "When you see these things," He said, "look up and lift up your heads for your redemption is at hand." That may seem a strange philosophy of history, but it is the authentic philosophy of Christ, and if the prospect of these things causes us to hang down our heads instead of lifting them up, it shows that there is something wrong with our point of view. I know we are apt to feel this does not apply to us—that it merely refers to the end of the world. But to the Christian the world is always ending, and every historical crisis is, as it were, a rehearsal for the real thing. 

As the world changes, our task is to seek goodness embodied in new forms, not only in abstract or historical forms, though these can serve as guiding lights in our work. But for the most part we will be stumbling in the dark, because this is work that is necessarily new, untried, even avoided. But it is crucial, in the literal sense that it is there that we find the cross of Christ, at the intersection of the old and the new, what was and what could be. Specifically I'm thinking of the Church's cross-cultural engagement, and our individual responsibility to take part in it in a concrete way, by learning another culture. But where else in our individual lives can we seek this crossroads?
