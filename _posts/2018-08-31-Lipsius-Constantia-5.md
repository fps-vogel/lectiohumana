> At erras etiam largiter, Lipsi, in circumscribenda patria ipsa: astringis enim eam ad natale illud solum, quod institimus, quod pressimus: et quae alia mihi tinnis inani sonitu verborum. Petere enim illinc frustra vis insitas amoris huius causas. Nam si genitalis solius soli id nomen: patria mihi quidem Bruxella tantum erit, tibi Isscanum, alteri cuipiam tugurium aut magale. Immo multis nec tugurium quidem, sed silva et nudus ager. Amor ergo meus et cura, intra istos angustos limites conclusa? Villam illam tantum aut domum, ut patriam, amplectar et defendam? Vides ineptias. Et quam beati, te definiente, silvani illi aut agrestes, quorum natalis terra florens semper est, et paene extra omne cladis aut interitus discrimen. Sed non illud profecto Patria est, non: sed UNUS ALIQUIS STATUS, UT DIXI, ET COMMUNIS VELUT NAVIS, SUB UNO REGE AUT SUB UNA LEGE.

> *[Charles Lang has been pointing out the mistakes in Lipsius' patriotism for Belgium. Lipsius has said earlier that he is depressed because of the wars raging in Belgium.]* But you make a more fundamental mistake, Lipsius, in thinking that your homeland is only the place where you were born and raised, the earth your little feet loved to step on, or some such sentimental drivel. If you think the physical place explains your love of home, think again. If our homeland is only the place where we were born, then my home is Brussels, yours is tiny Iscanum,<sup>1</sup> someone else's is just a hut out in the boonies, and to many people it's not even a hut but just forest and bare fields.<sup>2</sup> Am I to put all my love and concern into such a limited space? Am I to cherish and defend as my homeland only my house and my backyard? You see how silly this is. And how fortunate are those forest-dwellers or fieldlings! According to your definition, their homeland is always flourishing, far away from war and destruction. But no, that is not the meaning of home, not at all. Home is *a certain social and spiritual structure*, as I said before, and *a kind of ship built for a community, all under one captain or under one law*.

Where is our home, who are our people? If we thought more carefully about these questions, so much violence and spiritual poverty could be avoided. As Christopher Dawson argues in *The Crisis of Western Education*, if young people are not inculturated into a spiritually nourishing culture, they will struggle to find an identity in anything other than race or nationality, which needlessly separate us with often violent consequences.

Often our family, our faith community, and our schools lead us into a culture other than this spiritually nourishing culture that is broadly human without being shallow. But however that may be, even if our elders have given us a good start, we must always continue our own education, journeying in search of a homeland that will make us whole, alive, and empowered to help others on their own journey.

1. Somewhere between Brussels and Leuven, according [this article on Lipsius](https://books.google.com/books?id=jWo7AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA751&lpg=PA751&dq=iscanum).

2. Lang's comments about forests and fields may seem puzzling, but I believe he refers to people from rural areas whose house no longer exists and whose land now belongs to someone else, or is uncultivated. I was born and raised in a rural community in Brazil which has since been sold and repurposed, and thinking about it can be painfully nostalgic, full of [*saudades*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudade). And this lends an extra level of sarcasm to Lang's comment later in this passage that these people's homeland is always flourishing.
