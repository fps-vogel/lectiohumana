> An non pessimo Daemonio obnoxius est, quem totum possidet ambitio, avaritia, livor, odium, libido, ceteraeque cupiditates impiae? Huiusmodi qui sunt, non ferunt sermonem Evangelicum, sed vociferantur: Quid tibi nobiscum est, Iesu? Venisti ut perderes nos? Etenim quos possidet huius mundi Spiritus, perdi se credunt, quoties coguntur in ea relinquere, in quibus sibi falsam constituere felicitatem. ... Maius autem miraculum est, ex ambitioso modestum, ex feroci tolerantem, ex libidinoso castum, ex rapaci liberalem reddere, quam corpus hominis ab impio Spiritu liberare. Sed illud magis admirantur homines, non quia mirabilius, sed quia cernatur oculis corporeis. (26-27)

> Isn't it the worst demon possession, to be filled with unhealthy ambition, greed, envy, hatred, lust, and other impure desires? People like this can't stand talk of the gospel but shout, "What do you have to do with us, Jesus? Did you come to destroy us?" Because these people, possessed by the spirit of this world, do believe themselves to be destroyed when they're forced to leave their false happiness in the places where they've set it up.

A high-powered career, for example, takes more out of us than we get back, a fact which we don't always realize before it's sapped our soul, severed our ties to family and friends, and robbed us of all ordinary pleasures. We've already set up our achievements and lifestyle and social status, so envied by people lower down the ladder that we're afraid to admit our mistake and take a new path, because that would mean losing even this sham that we've acquired at the cost of everything.

> Accidit autem, ut die quodam, posteaquam Iesus in monte quodam multa praeclara docuisset populum de perfectione professionis Evangelicae: descendenti occurreret quidam lepra, morbo abominabili pariter et insanabili, infectus, in quo corporeis oculis exhiberetur imago eorum, quae invisibiliter gesserat in animis auditorum. Oderat morbum suum leprosus, ac summam de Iesu conceperat fiduciam. ... Non veritus est turbam, cui se sciebat esse abominandum: tantum Iesu bonitatem habebat prae oculis. Ad hunc igitur accurrit: accidit ad genua. (40)

> One day after Jesus had stood on a hill and taught about the fullness of a life after his own, on the way down he met a man with leprosy, a disgusting and incurable disease. In this man we see a picture of what was going on inside everyone else. The leper hated his disease and had put all his hope in Jesus. He wasn't afraid of the crowd, which he knew was disgusted by him, but he had only Jesus' kindness in his sights. So to Jesus he ran, and got down on his knees.

This is the way to seek after the highest good: heedless of the criticism of the crowd, focused only on the goal, firm in our conviction that this is indeed the path we should run, not only for our own well-being (as for the leper's) but also for the sake of people we can help through our particular path. Do you do parkour? Teach it to kids who don't otherwise know the skill of practicing toward a goal, and don't worry about raised eyebrows. Are you an artist, a musician, a gardener? Make your neighborhood a more beautiful place. Do you like thinking and delving into history? Make the life of the mind more lively and attractive to people you know.
