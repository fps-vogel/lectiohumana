Thanks to [the work](https://www.academia.edu/33849970/Written_Monuments_Bezas_Icones_as_Testament_to_and_Program_for_Reformist_Humanism) of E. J. Hutchinson, many of us are aware of Theodore Beza’s emblems. The enigmatic woodcuts and poetry of emblem books were also employed by less well-known Protestant writers, but no less vividly and even hauntingly, to picture life in light of God. Among these was Georgette de Montenay, a lady-in-waiting to the Queen of Navarre. Her emblems went through several editions in the decades after their publication in 1567, culminating in [a 1619 polyglot edition](https://archive.org/details/monumentaemblema00mont/page/34) which contains no fewer than *eight* versions of the text by various hands: the original French, two in Latin, and one each in Spanish, Italian, German, English, and Dutch. Evidently this recondite work was in high demand.
