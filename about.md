> Certis ingeniis immorari et innutriri oportet, si velis aliquid trahere quod in animo fideliter sedeat. Nusquam est qui ubique est. (Seneca, *Epistulae Morales* 1.2)

> You must spend time with certain thinkers and feed on them only, if you want to draw out something that will stick in your mind. If you are everywhere, you are nowhere.

Hi there! On this blog I cultivate classical humanistic reading, or in other words, I read to live better. Erasmus says it best:

> Quoties Princeps librum sumet in manum, hoc animo sumat, non ut delectetur, sed ut melior a lectione discedat. Facile invenit unde reddatur melior, qui hoc vehementer studet, ut melior fiat.

> Whenever the prince picks up a book, he should read not for entertainment, but so that becomes a better person. If we have a burning desire to become better people, we will easily find the means.

### What does "lectio humana" mean?

"Human reading," a play on *lectio divina* with a nod to the humanists, whose work I'm spending time with.

### Why all the Latin?

Because I love it. Also, it's good to seek wisdom in other worlds: in the case of Latin, the pre-industrial Graeco-Roman tradition.

### Why all the Christian stuff? I thought you said humanists.

I mean the humanists of the Renaissance, and their forebears and successors. If you think humanism is just another name for atheism, please read these:
