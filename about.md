Hi there! The classical humanists of the Renaissance are little known today, but I'm digging into writings by them and some traditionally-minded modern writers, and I'm sharing my reflections on this blog. All the while I'm keeping in mind the advice of Erasmus:

> Quoties Princeps librum sumet in manum, hoc animo sumat, non ut delectetur, sed ut melior a lectione discedat. Facile invenit unde reddatur melior, qui hoc vehementer studet, ut melior fiat. (*Institutio Principis Christiani* 2.21)
{:.latin}

> Whenever the prince picks up a book, he should read not for entertainment, but so that becomes a better person. If we have a burning desire to become better people, we will easily find the means. (*Education of a Christian Prince* 2.21)

And below is further reading on some of the topics that form the background of this blog.

### HUMANISM
Of the many "humanisms," Christian humanism is the most complete.

* [*Making Modernity Human: Can Christian humanism redeem an age of ideology?*](http://www.theimaginativeconservative.org/2012/11/making-modernity-human-can-christian.html)

### PROTESTANTS & HUMANISM
We Protestants in particular have distanced ourselves from the label of humanism, but in fact the Reformers themselves were humanists. Natural law, for example, was essential to their vision for society.

### TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
The expanding role of technology in our lives is more dangerous than many people suspect.
