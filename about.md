Hi there! What is *humanism?* There are many humanisms, and I'm searching for the best kind, sharing my reflections on this blog along the way and following the advice of Erasmus:

> Quoties Princeps librum sumet in manum, hoc animo sumat, non ut delectetur, sed ut melior a lectione discedat. Facile invenit unde reddatur melior, qui hoc vehementer studet, ut melior fiat. (Institutio Principis Christiani 2.21)
{:.latin}

> Whenever the prince picks up a book, he should read not for entertainment, but so that becomes a better person. If we have a burning desire to become better people, we will easily find the means. (Education of a Christian Prince 2.21)

### What does "lectio humana" mean?

It's a play on *lectio divina.*

### Why all the Christian stuff? I thought you said humanism.

Of the many "humanisms," Christian humanism is the best and one of the oldest. If you think humanism is just another name for atheism, please read this: [*What Went Wrong In Europe?
