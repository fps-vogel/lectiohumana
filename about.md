Hi there! The classical humanists of the Renaissance are little known today, but I'm reading some of their writings (and those of traditionally-minded modern writers) and sharing my reflections on this blog, while following the advice of Erasmus:

> Quoties Princeps librum sumet in manum, hoc animo sumat, non ut delectetur, sed ut melior a lectione discedat. Facile invenit unde reddatur melior, qui hoc vehementer studet, ut melior fiat. (Institutio Principis Christiani 2.21)
{:.latin}

> Whenever the prince picks up a book, he should read not for entertainment, but so that becomes a better person. If we have a burning desire to become better people, we will easily find the means. (Education of a Christian Prince 2.21)

And below is further reading on some of the topics that form the background of this blog.

### HUMANISM
Of the many "humanisms," Christian humanism is the best and one of the oldest.

### PROTESTANTISM & HUMANISM
We Protestants in particular have distanced ourselves from the label of humanism, but in fact the Reformers themselves were humanists, and natural law was essential to their vision for society.
