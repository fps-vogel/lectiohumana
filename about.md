Hi there! What is *humanism?* There are many humanisms, and I'm searching for the best kind, sharing my reflections on this blog along the way and following the advice of Erasmus:

> Quoties Princeps librum sumet in manum, hoc animo sumat, non ut delectetur, sed ut melior a lectione discedat. Facile invenit unde reddatur melior, qui hoc vehementer studet, ut melior fiat. (Institutio Principis Christiani 2.21)
{:.latin}

> Whenever the prince picks up a book, he should read not for entertainment, but so that becomes a better person. If we have a burning desire to become better people, we will easily find the means. (Education of a Christian Prince 2.21)

Here are some favorite posts:

### PROTESTANTISM & HUMANISM
We Protestants in particular have distanced ourselves from the label of humanism, but in fact, the Reformers themselves were humanists, and natural law was essential to their vision for society.
