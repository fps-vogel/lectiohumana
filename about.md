Hi there! On this blog I cultivate classical humanistic reading, or in other words, I read to live better. Erasmus says it best:

> Quoties Princeps librum sumet in manum, hoc animo sumat, non ut delectetur, sed ut melior a lectione discedat. Facile invenit unde reddatur melior, qui hoc vehementer studet, ut melior fiat. (Institutio Principis Christiani 2.21)

> Whenever the prince picks up a book, he should read not for entertainment, but so that becomes a better person. If we have a burning desire to become better people, we will easily find the means. (Education of a Christian Prince 2.21)

### What does "lectio humana" mean?

"Human reading," a play on *lectio divina* with a nod to the humanists, whose work I'm spending time with.

### Why all the Latin?

Because I love it, and it helps us take off our blinders by stepping into another world, the pre-industrial Graeco-Roman tradition, which is also the spiritual heritage of Christians and the whole Westernized world. Because this tradition has fallen by the wayside, children and adolescents are not spiritually nourished in our public and most private schools, the practice of Western Christianity and its offspring in "developing countries" is shallow, and Westernization across the world is a double-edged sword of material development and spiritual destruction.

### Why all the Christian stuff? I thought you said humanists.

I mean the humanists of the Renaissance, and their forebears and successors. If you think humanism is just another name for atheism, please read these:
